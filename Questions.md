# Git Basics

# Learn the fundamentals

If you have never used Git before, learn the basics first. You can use one of these resources:

- https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRZGeaHPoaw

Or any other resources you find and like.

Git and Github keep changing things as they are continuously developed. If something doesn’t look exactly the same way in the tutorial as it does on your computer, 

- check the comments under the video to spot whether anyone has had the same problem and how they solved it.
- If that doesn’t help google for a solution.
- If that doesn’t yield any results, ask for help in the git discord channel.

Everyone, even those of you who are Git and GitHub pros, should go through the following two resources:

- Branching model
- Contribution rules and git flow

# Do exercises to get to a good level

Below, we have put together a collection of git exercises, which are made to help you get a better understanding of git. You need to work through all of these exercises, to make sure you are at a good level.

> For all the exercises below there is a solution playlist on youtube, that Yannick (CTO of Octan Group and Tech Lead at The Gym) recorded for you (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnLXJSAQnxY7Kv9BLPh2T2YtcQUkZOkUe). Don’t watch the tutorial videos straight away. First try solving the exercise yourself.
> 

Before starting these exercises, please create one Github repository that you will use to paste your terminal history into after each exercise. Call it “Gym Git Exercise Solutions” or similar. Make sure it has a readme file.

The process for solving the exercises is as follows:

- First try to solve the exercise on your own (without peaking into the solution!). You are allowed google git commands, if you don’t remember them or if you need to read up on them.
- Next watch the solution video for the exercise you just completed.
- If you feel you may have done some things wrong, do the exercise again. But while you are doing it again, don’t peak at the video. Do it from memory.
- Now you can watch the video again (possibly at double speed, or skipping to the bits that you have doubts about) to double check if you did everything right this time.
- If you feel you still had mistakes, do the exercise again. Again, do it from memory, don’t peak at the video. And then afterwards check the video again etc. etc.
- Once you are confident that you have got the right solution, copy the terminal commands you used in your last try and past them in the readme file of the “Gym Git Exercise Solutions” repository you have created. All Solutions to all exercises should be pasted into the readme file of this repository. Even when an exercise requires you to create a Github repository for the purposes of solving the exercise, nevertheless always use the “Gym Git Exercise Solutions” readme file to paste your terminal history into. Watch this video to learn how to do this.
- Insert the link to the “Gym Git Exercise Solutions” Github repository as well as the link to the Github repository you created for this exercise (if there was such a repository in this exercise) into the appropriate Trello card on the trainee task Trello board your coach has created for you. Please note that there are no peer code reviews for the git exercises. You will only be reviewed by your coaches.

# **Bundle 1**

Exercise 1

- Create a project folder & initialize git
- Make changes to the project (add files and contents)
- Rename your main branch from `master` to `main` (If your branch name is already `main` then rename it to `master` and then back to `main`)
- Stage your changes and commit them
- Create a Github repo and connect it with your project
- Push your changes to GitHub
- Create a new branch `dev`
- From `dev` create another branch `test`
- Go back to the `dev` branch and delete the `test` branch

Exercise 2

- Create a new `home.html` file, add some html changes and save them
- Stash save your current changes
- Repeat the same process for a new `about.html` page and stash save your changes
- Repeat the same process for a new `team.html` page and stash save your changes
- Using stash pop restore the changes of the `about.html` page
- With the help of an index use stash pop bring back the `home.html` page changes
- Commit the current changes and push them
- Using stash pop restore the changes of the `team.html` page index
- Reset the current changes using git reset and go back to the changes without the `team.html` page

# Bundle 2

Exercises 1

- Create a new branch named `ft/bundle-2`
- Add new changes to your project. create a new page named `services.html` and add some changes
- Commit your changes and create a Pull Request against the `main` branch in your github repository
